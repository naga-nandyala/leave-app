The app comes pre-configured with major economies, defined in `src/config/countries.json`:

```json
{
  "countries": {
    "AU": {"name": "Australia", "code": "AU"},
    "CN": {"name": "China", "code": "CN"},

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Holiday Updates**: Generate holidays at least annually
2. **Advance Planning**: Add OOO requests well in advance
3. **Team Communication**: Use the calendar as a team reference
4. **History Review**: Monitor usage patterns via history logs
5. **Data Backup**: Regularly backup the `data/` directory

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for expansion:

- Team coverage recommendations
- Export to popular calendar formats
- Integration with HR systems
- Multi-year calendar views
- Approval workflows for OOO requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Empty Calendar**: Add team members first, then generate holidays

**Missing Holidays**: Click "Generate Holidays for Team" after adding members

**OOO Not Showing**: Ensure the date range is correct and member is selected

**Regional Holidays Missing**: Verify the member's region is correctly set

**Delete Member Not Working**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled; check browser console for errors. Recent improvements have resolved most delete functionality issues.

**Member Names with Special Characters**: The app now properly handles names with apostrophes, quotes, and special characters in the delete functionality.

### Getting Help

1. Check the **History** page for operation logs
2. Verify team members have correct location information
3. Ensure holidays have been generated for your team's locations
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
