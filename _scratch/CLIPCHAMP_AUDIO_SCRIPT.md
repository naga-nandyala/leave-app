"Managing a global team across different countries and time zones? Keeping track of holidays, vacations, and who's available when? It's a scheduling nightmare that costs businesses time, money, and missed opportunities."

## **Segment 3: Smart Team Management Demo (0:35 - 1:10)**

**[Professional, demonstrative]**

"Let's see how easy it is to manage your global team. I'm adding Sarah Johnson from New York to our team.

## **Segment 4: Interactive Calendar Demo (1:10 - 1:50)**

**[Engaging, explanatory]**

"Now for the real magic - our interactive calendar view. Here's our team spread across Australia, China, and the United States. Green means available, red means unavailable."

**[Pause: 0.5 seconds]**

"Click any red date to see exactly why someone's unavailable - whether it's Australia Day for Naga, Chinese New Year for Xing, or personal vacation time."

**[Pause: 0.5 seconds]**

"Adding time off is just as simple. Click any available date, select the team member, choose your dates and reason - vacation, conference, sick leave, or personal time - and click add. The calendar updates instantly across all views."

**[Pause: 1 second]**

## **Segment 5: Global Holiday Intelligence (1:50 - 2:20)**

**[Confident, technical]**

"But here's what makes this truly powerful - intelligent holiday management. The system automatically knows that China has different holidays than Australia, that New York has different bank holidays than California."

**[Pause: 0.5 seconds]**

"One click generates hundreds of accurate holidays across all your team locations for the current and next year. Always up-to-date, always accurate, powered by the constantly-updated Python holidays library."
