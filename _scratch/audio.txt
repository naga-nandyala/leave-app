Welcome to the Team Availability & Leave Management App — a tool designed to simplify how teams manage availability, holidays, and out-of-office notifications across multiple countries and regions.

The heart of the app is the interactive calendar. It gives you a clear, color-coded view of team availability. You can add out-of-office entries directly by clicking the '+' icon on any date.

Managing your team is easy. Add or remove members, and assign them to specific countries and regions. The app supports Australia, China, and the United States — with full regional breakdowns. New countries can be added by a simple configuration change.

...
...
Generate holidays automatically using the built-in Python holidays library. The app supports national and regional holidays, and you can even add custom company holidays.


... 
...
...
Track out-of-office entries with ease. Add multi-day absences, specify reasons like vacation or sick leave, and cancel entries when needed — all from the calendar.


... 
...
...
Every action is logged in the History tab — from member changes to holiday generation and OOO updates. It’s your complete audit trail.
